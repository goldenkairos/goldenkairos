About Me
------------------------------------------------------------------------
😄 Pronouns: She/Her

🌱 I just completed my apprenticeship program with Microsoft and recently graduated from ADA Developers Academy.

🏫 Ada Developers Academy is a selective training and internship program for women, non-binary and gender diverse individuals to break into the tech sector. The application process, which spanned several months, included an initial application which included essays and a data analysis challenge, a time-boxed scripting challenge in Python, a code review/technical interview, and a final panel interview. 

📚 Technical Skills
  - Python, C++, SQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and React and Computer Science fundamentals
