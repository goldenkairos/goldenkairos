🌱 I’m currently learning attending ADA Developer Academy
🏫 Ada Developers Academy is a selective training and internship program for women, non-binary and gender diverse individuals to break into the tech sector. The application process, which spanned several months, included an initial application which included essays and a data analysis challenge, a time-boxed scripting challenge in Python, a code review/technical interview, and a final panel interview. 
📚 In the classroom portion of the year long program, students gain experience in 
  - Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and React ad Computer Science fundamentals
  - Agile development teams, using pair programming, scrum, and test-driven development.
  - Advocating for inclusivity and social justice in tech industry
📈 The classroom portion is followed by a 5 month industry internship with a sponsoring company in Seattle.
